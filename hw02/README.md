The code works by running the sketch.py file using "./sketch.py"

User will enter their board size which will be NxN
Buttons should be connected to GPIO pin P8_{12, 15, 16} and P9_{14,16}
Arrange the buttons preferably in an way that makes sense to you. 
Left is P8_12
Right is P9_16
Up is P8_15
Down is P8_16
Clear is P9_14
When you click a button you will either sketch in that direction or clear if hitting the clear button.
