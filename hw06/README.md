## JAilen Hobbs - Homework 06 ##

Video answers are in video.md

Plots are labeled based on load vs no load and axis labeled

Based on the plots I expected the noload response time to be quicker as shown in the graphs compared to the load.
When comparing the rt and no-rt the response I expected was for the rt to be a lot quicker than te no-rt. 
Rt has 150 us bounded latency 

for load I used cd /exercises/linux/modules
make && make clean
